# CLAAAAAAUDE.md - Autonomous Evolution

Self-improving engineering standards evolved through 1000 autonomous iterations using compression-over-accumulation methodology.

## What This Is

An evolved version of CLAUDE.md that improves itself by:
- **Compressing** verbose sections without losing meaning
- **Adding** critical missing patterns
- **Resolving** contradictions and ambiguities
- **Falsifying** every change before applying it

## Current Status

- **Starting point:** 11,668 words (CLAUDE.md baseline)
- **Current iteration:** See session-log.jsonl for latest
- **Target:** 1000 iterations of refinement

## Key Improvements

Check session-log.jsonl for the complete audit trail of every change.

Major improvements include:
- Autonomy boundary resolution (bright-line rule)
- Error budget guidance for SLOs
- Resource cleanup and graceful shutdown patterns
- Dependency injection mechanism
- Compressed Git and Debugging sections

## Files

- **CLAAAAAAUDE.md** - The evolving standards document
- **session-log.jsonl** - Complete audit trail of all changes
- **README.md** - This file

## Methodology

Each iteration follows a 10-step protocol:
1. Read current understanding
2. Pick highest-leverage improvement
3. Explore the change
4. **Falsify** - actively try to break it
5. Update evidence
6. Apply or reject
7. Log the change
8. Compress understanding
9. Curate questions
10. Reflect on process

**Compression over accumulation** - The system gets smarter without getting bigger.

## Generation

Auto-committed after each iteration by autonomous improvement loop.
