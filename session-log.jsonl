{"iteration":21,"timestamp":"2026-02-17T12:00:00Z","change":"Resolved autonomy boundary contradiction in Section 11. Added bright-line rule: conformance to standards in new code is silent; restructuring existing code is ask-first. Clarified apply-silently list with concrete examples. Clarified ask-before list to distinguish restructuring from conforming. Falsified against 8 scenarios.","files_modified":["CLAAAAAAUDE.md","evidence/autonomy-boundary.md","map.md","frontier.md","meta.md","session-log.jsonl"],"change_type":"fix","words_delta":55}
{"iteration":22,"timestamp":"2026-02-17T16:00:00Z","change":"Added error budget guidance to Section 18. Inserted after SLO definitions: error budget formula, 4-tier spending strategy (>50% ship aggressively, 25-50% normal pace, <25% freeze risky deploys, exhausted feature freeze). Fills the #1 gap making SLOs actionable for velocity-vs-reliability decisions.

{"iteration":23,"timestamp":"2026-02-17T20:00:00Z","change":"Compressed Section 1 (Git) by ~20%. Eliminated 7 categories of redundancy: semver mapping prose to shorthand, Law 2 exhaustive separation mappings, Law 4 scan instructions duplicating Pre-Commit Protocol, Law 5 prose duplicating command lists, fixup workflow duplication between Branching and Advanced Workflows, dependency-order commits duplicating Law 3, file rename duplicating Law 2. All Five Laws preserved. Pre-Commit Protocol untouched. Zero behavioral changes.","files_modified":["CLAAAAAAUDE.md","evidence/git-compression.md","map.md","frontier.md","meta.md","session-log.jsonl"],"change_type":"refactor","words_delta":-380}
{"iteration":24,"timestamp":"2026-02-17T23:00:00Z","change":"Added delineating sentence to Section 21 clarifying relationship with Section 10: Section 10 owns deployment requirements/infrastructure, Section 21 owns pipeline gates/execution. Analysis found the overlap is requirement-vs-implementation pattern (not harmful redundancy), but lacked explicit delineation. Zero contradictions found.

{"iteration":25,"timestamp":"2026-02-17T23:45:00Z","change":"Compressed Section 12 (Debugging) by ~325 words. Four surgical edits: (1) Decision tree replaced leaf-node restatements with phase references, keeping only novel branching logic. (2) Anti-patterns section compressed 5 redundant entries to name+rule-reference format, kept 3 unique entries intact. (3) Phase 4 commit examples condensed from verbose bodies to structure+subject-lines with format cross-reference to Section 1. (4) Git bisect tutorial reduced from step-by-step ceremony to principle+automation-tip. All 6 phases, 5 fix quality rules, emergency hotfix protocol, and temporary debug logging protocol preserved.

{"iteration":26,"timestamp":"2026-02-17T24:30:00Z","change":"Clarified 'max 3 parameters' rule in Section 3 with scope qualifier: applies to signatures you define, not callback signatures imposed by frameworks or runtime APIs. Analyzed 4 edge cases (constructors, config objects, callbacks, math functions). Only callbacks had genuine ambiguity; constructors and config objects work correctly under existing rule; math functions too rare and abuse-prone to codify exception. +17 words.","files_modified":["CLAAAAAAUDE.md","evidence/max-3-params-edge-cases.md","map.md","frontier.md","meta.md","session-log.jsonl"],"change_type":"fix","words_delta":17}
{"iteration":27,"timestamp":"2026-02-17T25:15:00Z","change":"Added resource cleanup and graceful shutdown guidance to Section 3. Two additions: (1) RESOURCE CLEANUP rule requiring finally blocks for all acquired resources (DB transactions, file handles, streams, event listeners) — generalizes the Section 15 lock-specific finally mention into a universal principle. (2) GRACEFUL SHUTDOWN pattern (SIGTERM → stop accepting → drain in-flight → close pools → exit) — provides the process-level mechanism required by Sections 10/14/21 zero-downtime deployment rules. Resolves implicit contradiction: document required zero-downtime deploys without providing the enabling mechanism.

{"iteration":28,"timestamp":"2026-02-17T26:00:00Z","change":"Added DEPENDENCY DELIVERY mechanism to Section 2. Services must receive adapters via constructor or factory parameters, never via direct import of adapter instances. Fills mechanism gap: Section 2 defined dependency direction (handlers→services→core→adapters), Section 5 required mock-at-boundaries testing, but neither specified how services actually receive their adapter dependencies. Without this, developers import adapters directly in services (tight coupling, untestable without module mocking hacks). The rule connects architecture (Section 2) to testability (Section 5) by providing the explicit wiring pattern both implicitly require.","files_modified":["CLAAAAAAUDE.md","evidence/dependency-delivery-mechanism.md","map.md","frontier.md","meta.md","session-log.jsonl"],"change_type":"feat","words_delta":60}

Inserted after LIMIT/OFFSET guidance: warns that OFFSET is O(n) in skipped rows and directs to keyset/cursor pagination per Section 13 for tables exceeding 10K rows. Resolves inconsistency where the Performance section taught an anti-pattern without caveat while the API section (Section 13) correctly recommended cursor pagination for large datasets.

Section 8 required 'request ID for tracing' and 'propagate across service boundaries' but never specified how request IDs are generated, attached to context, or forwarded. Section 12 (Debugging) also depends on request IDs being available. Added 4-step mechanism: middleware generates UUID from X-Request-ID header or creates new one, attaches to request context for automatic logger inclusion, forwards on outbound HTTP calls, includes in async message envelopes.
