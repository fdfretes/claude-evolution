Applied adversarial compliance testing lens: tested 10 scenarios where a practitioner tries to satisfy the letter of rules while violating their spirit (function length manipulation, test assertion combining, trivial regression tests, permissive validation, column enumeration, giant options objects, micro-commits, security scan evasion, numeric boolean substitution, flag name near-reuse). All 8 genuine attacks blocked by document's consistent mechanical-constraint + intent-clause pairing pattern. 2 scenarios correctly permitted as non-attacks.

Applied partial adoption safety lens: tested 5 decomposition scenarios (debugging without testing, git without workflow, performance without database, security without error handling, resilience without logging). All sections are self-contained and safe in isolation — cross-references are informational pointers, not prerequisite dependencies. Section architecture mirrors code architecture: cohesive, loosely coupled, independently valuable.

Applied misapplication recovery lens: tested 8 honest-mistake scenarios where a practitioner misunderstands a specific rule. 3 CAUGHT by structural friction (dependency direction violations create test inability; commit granularity violations caught by Law 2 + Newspaper Test). 3 PARTIALLY CAUGHT by review + indirect mechanisms (large options objects, non-failing regression tests, never-mock strategy). 2 SILENT but low-severity (enumerating all columns instead of needed ones, hand-rolled redundant validation in core) — inherently require context-dependent human judgment, no actionable edit possible without the document becoming tool-specific or prescriptive about developer cognition.
